### Configuring The Bot

-   **Install Dependencies**:

-   **Set Up Environment Variables**:

    -   Create a `./src/config/index.js` or `./src/config.js` file in the root directory of the project.
    -   Add the following lines, replacing placeholders with actual values:

        ```
        // Set to true if your application has extra commands that need to be cleared
        module.exports.CLEAR_BOT_COMMANDS = false;
        // Set to true if you need to register the rsn or highscore command
        module.exports.REGISTER_BOT_COMMANDS = false;

        module.exports.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = 'yourBotToken';

        module.exports.WOM_USER_AGENT = '@yourDiscordHandle';
        module.exports.WOM_API_KEY = 'yourApiKeyOrBlank';
        module.exports.WOM_GROUP_NUMBER = 'yourGroupNumber';
        module.exports.WOM_SECURITY_CODE = 'groupSecurityCode';

        'owner','deputy owner','coordinator',
        'admin','saviour','server bots',
        ]);
        ```

### Running the Bot

-   **Start the Bot**:
    -   Run `npm run start` from the project directory to start the bot.

### Bot Permissions

When invited to a server, the bot creates a `@<bot-name>` role.

-   Position this role above others that it will manage and below any sensitive roles.
-   Give the `@<bot-name>` role these permissions:
    -   Manage Roles
    -   Manage Nicknames

## Features

### Automated Rank-Roles

-   Every minute the bot utilizes the WiseOldMan API to fetch a map of all
    in-game member rsns and their rank.
-   The bot then looks up all members in all of its Discord servers, and checks if their nickname matches an in-game rsn.
-   Multiple RSNs are supported in member nicknames, use: `|`, `&` or `/` to delimit each RSN.
    -   e.g. If a member has the nickname `"Roelof | Foleor / Loroef"`, we split, trim and collect each RSN.<br>Which
        results in: `"Roelof", "Foleor", "Loroef"`.
-   Members whose nickname matches one of the in-game rsns are assigned their rank-roles automatically.
    -   The bot will automatically create rank-roles as required, if they do not exist in the server.
    -   For members with multiple names, all names are looked up and the highest applicable rank-role is given to the
        user.
    -   There are explicit restrictions preventing `@Saviour`, `@Deputy Owner`, or `@Owner` from automatically being
        assigned.
    -   Members whose nickname doesn't match an in-game rsn are given the `@Guest` rank-role.

### Commands

-   **`/rsn <your-rsn>`** sets the supplied rsn as the users nickname in the server.
-   **`/highscore <type>`** sends embeds for the selected highscores.

### Reactions

-   **Reacts** with ðŸ«¡ to all messages sent in the `#ðŸ¥³-âŠ±newcomers` channel.

### Status Updates

-   **Updates** the bot's status **every minute** with random stats from the clan.
-   **Caches** data for 1 hour.

### Group Updates

-   **Updates** the WiseOldMan group every `6th hour` (e.g. 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00).
